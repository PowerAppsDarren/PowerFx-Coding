This prompt is for video titled:
Start with H1 heading containing the video title.

Objective: Create a comprehensive UI/UX design reference document optimized for AI coding assistants and CLI tools from the specified YouTube video source.

Input: Draw exclusively from the single designated video source provided in this session.

Output Requirements:

-   Format: Bulleted markdown (.md) with clear hierarchical organization
-   Main Heading: Video title as H1 (Example: # [Video Title])
-   No citation numbers or bracketed references (avoid , [a, b])
-   Style: Concise, technical, directive statements for direct code implementation
-   Prioritization: Lead with fundamental principles, then specific actionable techniques

Structure & Organization:
Maximum four hierarchical levels, grouped by UI/UX categories.

Example high-level categories:

1. Design Philosophy & Principles (Fundamental Rules)
2. Color & Theming (HSL/OKLCH, Dark Mode)
3. Typography (Scale, Weight, Line Height)
4. Layout & Responsive Design (Flexbox, Grid, Spacing Systems)
5. Native HTML Component Implementation (Accessibility/Simplicity Hacks)
6. Advanced Techniques & Best Practices (Depth, Shadows, Performance)

Content Focus:
Extract actionable, technical guidelines:

-   Directive Statements: Direct instructions (e.g., "Use HSL," "Apply display: flex")
-   Specific Code/Techniques: Explicit CSS/HTML attributes, properties, values (e.g., contenteditable, <dialog>, flex-wrap: wrap, inputmode)
-   Design Rules: Explicit rules/ratios (e.g., proportional sizing, spacing divisible by four)
-   Best Practices: Modern frameworks, optimization tips (WEBP, SVG), common mistakes to avoid

Goal: Self-contained quick-reference guide enabling AI agents to make informed UI/UX decisions based solely on principles from the video source.
