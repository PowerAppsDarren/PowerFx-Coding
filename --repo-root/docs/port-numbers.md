# Appointing Port Numbers

Port 80, 8080, 3000, 3001, etc. are very commond port number choices. There is a high probability that all those ports are being used for something else. Just assume they are and pick a random port number between 50000 and 60000. Then immediately check this port number and verify it isn't being used by anything else!
